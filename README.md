3. I am a currently a Junior in NJIT persuing a degree in Information Technology. I am local to Jersey City, NJ where I was born and raised. My hobbies consists of playing video games, fixing my car and motorcycle. I also work two jobs throughout the semester as a cafe manager and an IT Technician at an MSP. I'm very interested in Cloud Computing but I'm more skillful in Linux. I plan on learning AWS and Azure but also want to become Red Hat certified so I'm stuck on what career path I want to persue. I'm also very interested in this class because I never worked with Git and Github before and learning new things makes me excited. Looking forward to this semester in IT202.
